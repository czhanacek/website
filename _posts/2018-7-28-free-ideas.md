### 1. Sunscreen shower

because putting on the sunscreen is the part I like least about going outside when the weather is nice.

### 2. Rumor

a decentralized data store where random nodes must store other users data. it uses proof of work as a payment system, which would directly corelate to amount of data able to be stored by a particular user. each file or "storage segment" would have a sufficiently large "hop sequence" which would obscure its true location. Only after a successful hop sequence would the file be able to be retrieved. This depends on all the "knowing nodes" being available to relay. A knowing node only knows the next leap in the sequence, not the full path. The leap only exists on the knowing node for a year (by default), but longer term storage can be specified (at a greater cost to the user by all the knowing nodes).
