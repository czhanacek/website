title: Accessing a Raspberry Pi From Home
---

I was surfing the web this morning and found this article on how to use a VPS (or any computer you have access to with a public static IP) to forward an SSH connection to a Raspberry Pi. [Here's the article](https://www.tunnelsup.com/raspberry-pi-phoning-home-using-a-reverse-remote-ssh-tunnel/)

In the future, I'd like to extend the forwarding functionality to include HTTP/HTTPS. If you already know how to do this, drop me a line on Twitter (@czhanacek) or send me an email ([my first name]@[this website]).
