title: Free Halloween Costume Ideas
---

I always think of the best costume ideas after Halloween, so here’s a list to serve as inspiration when crunch time comes around next October.

#### 1. **"I’ll be Bach"**

A Frankensteined monstrosity of the Terminator and Johann Sebastian Bach. Could be fun.

#### 2. **CFL Light Bulb**

CFL light bulbs are becoming a thing of the past as LEDs take first place in the race for the most energy efficient lighting system. Add the fact that CFL bulbs have some mercury in them and you’ve got yourself a spooky costume. Think of how fun it would be to create the curly tube! Bonus points if your bulb actually lights up. 

#### 3. **Frat Boy**

I’ll have to wait until I graduate WSU to use this one. It would be perfect for a soirée at a friend’s tastefully decorated apartment. 

#### 4. **Empty Public Bus**

This one is for the transit nerds/green peace people out there. Ridership is down but the transit authority hasn’t cut any routes, so there are a bunch of empty busses driving around. If this list was ranked by the quality of the ideas, this one might be at the bottom.

#### 5. **A GMO Corn Stalk**

This is basically a corn stalk in a zombie costume. 

#### 6. **Any building with a neo mansard roof**

The neo mansard roof style came out in the 70s and unfortunately was somewhat popular as a way to cheaply remodel an existing building. Someday, I’ll do a longer post specifically on neo mansards, but until then, they are indeed a scary sight to see. 

#### 7. **An Ugly Cell Tower**

Cell towers are the nasty underbelly of the cell phone era. Recent efforts to make cell towers less ugly/noticeable have been strong, but there are still plenty of the old ones that just look awful.
