title: The Issue With Credit and Github Forking
---

If you use Github to collaborate with others or just to show off your code, you probably already know what forking is. In case you don't, forking is where you make a copy of some else's project in your own repository. The expectation is that you will use this copy of a project to track your changes to the software as you contribute to the original repository. You could also use your fork to take the project in a new direction. The point is, you're supposed to do *something* with a forked repository. 

If you're involved in the software engineering field, you already know that Github is a great place to flex your skills as a developer. It helps potential employers recruit passionate, talented developers based on the quality of their code and what kinds of projects they tend to work on. If you have a lot of repositories that are forked from others, it also proves that you really know how to use git and are able work collaboratively with others on software. The way I see it, contributing to the repositories of others is a more valuable task than just working on single-developer projects.

Allow me to set the scene: There's an imaginary Github user. Let's call him Steve. Steve is average or worse than average at whatever coding he does. Maybe Steve's Github only has projects from his days as an undergrad Computer Science student. Or maybe Steve is still in college. Whatever the situation, Steve is looking for some kind of employment in the Computer Science field, whether it be an internship or a real job. In its current state, Steve's Github isn't anything special. He doesn't have any cool projects on it. So, to remedy this, Steve forks some "cool" projects that aren't under active development. Since they're stale, they will show his fork to be even with the source repository (which might imply that he recently got an approved pull request into that repository). To the recruiter who might peruse Steve's Github, it looks as if Steve has a diverse range of skills when he really just forked a repository and didn't work on it at all. 

Maybe I'm just competitive, but I think that there should be some kind of flag or message that shows clearly if a Github user has done any work on a repository. There should be a distinction between a repository that is just sitting on Steve's Github page, and one that he is actively contributing to. 

Obviously there are ways around this solution. You could just write a script that changed files and made bogus commits on a repository so that it looked like you had changed it. Nonetheless, adding a the message creates a hurdle that the lazy developer wouldn't want to jump over.
