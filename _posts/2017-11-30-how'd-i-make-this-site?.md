title: How'd I Make This Site?
---

Maybe you're reading this and you're thinking "Wow, Charlie did such a nice job on this website. Yes, it's a little slow, but the design is clean and pleasant." If you are, then first of all, thank you! This was my first serious attempt at building a static site that actually looked nice. 

This site is running on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is a lightweight web framework for static sites based upon Ruby on Rails (I think). I run that on a VPS hosted in Lithuania because that's where the best rates were and cost is a top priority for me as college student. The fact that the site is hosted in Lithuania impacts latency, but not to the degree that I had expected. I host a minecraft server on this VPS for some friends and there is very little lag.

All images on this site are run through [trimage](https://trimage.org/) so pages containing them load faster.
