title: Bainbridge Island Appreciation Post
---

I grew up on Bainbridge Island, a smallish bedroom community just a 35 minute ferry ride from Seattle. Visitors would often tell me that Bainbridge was so beautiful, but I never really saw it. That is, until I went to college and really spent some time away from home. [The Palouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palouse) is beautiful, but in a simpler way.

Bainbridge has dense woodlands, well-planned park and recreation areas, and frankly, a charming downtown area. People don’t want to seem too proud of living on Bainbridge for fear of being stereotyped as privileged, rich white people. However, I think privately, Islanders feel a strong sense of dignity for the place they call home.

### The Ferry
God knows what Bainbridge would be without the [Washington State Ferries (WSF)](http://wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/). The ferry allows Bainbridge to maintain its fairly rural vibe while still providing reasonable access to Seattle. Some think the ferry ride is a “shlep”, but I disagree. Sean Johnson of Lifehacker argues that everyone needs some [margins](https://lifehacker.com/5978171/why-you-need-more-margin-in-your-life-and-how-to-get-it) in their life, a time to relax and reflect. The ferry provides those margins naturally. Cell phone service over Puget Sound is crappy (at best) and on the surface, the ferry is pretty boring. However, it’s the perfect time to read a book, ponder, people-watch, or even nap. Just don’t be alarmed if you wake up with a ferry worker yelling at you that the boat has docked and it’s time to _disembark_.

### Public parks
Bainbridge is blessed with a powerful, ambitious, and well-funded [parks and recreation department](https://biparks.org/). The parks district hosts a bevy of camps, classes, and workshops covering everything from sailing to pottery to soccer, for several age ranges and skill levels. These events are hosted at the parks district’s properties, which consist of a variety of inland and waterfront parks. Improvement projects by the trail crews, volunteer organizations, or Eagle Scouts ensure that the parks are always evolving and maintained. So many tourists miss out on the rich outdoor recreation opportunities Bainbridge has to offer because not all of them are close to the ferry.
