# My Wishlist

Hello, Internet Stranger! Maybe you are feeling generous, or you feel that you are obligated by gift-giving holiday to buy/make me something. Either way, here is a list of things I'm currently hoping to acquire if you are looking for ideas.

- Bike lights, preferably rechargable over micro-USB (for consistency's sake)
- Raspberry Pi(s) of any vintage or model. 
- Patagonia or Cotopaxi fleece jacket, size men's medium
- Green or orange graphic t-shirts
- Running shorts, size men's medium
